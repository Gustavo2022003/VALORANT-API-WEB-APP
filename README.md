# How to run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Requirements
To run this application, ensure you have the following installed:

**Node.js**: You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en).

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd <project_directory>
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm i
```

‚ö†Ô∏è*(To install the dependecies you will need to open the terminal in the same directory as the index.js or package.json)*

# Set up environment variables üì•

Inside the root directory of this project there is a .env file.
You can change the PORT by editing this variable:
```makefile
PORT=<port_number>
```
Replace <port_number> with the desired port number for the server.

# Start the server üßÆ

You can start your server by oppening a new terminal on the root directory of this project and typing:

```bash
node index.js
```

or typing:

```bash
npm start
```

# Access the application ‚ùáÔ∏è
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:<port_number> where <port_number> is the port specified in the .env file.

*for example if you set PORT to 8000 in the `.env` file, then it would be http://localhost:8000/*
